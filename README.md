# CuffsUP - grimly branch
This version is or will be mostly broken this is my build I will do when I am testing, this will help me keep the master branch script stable when I want to try new things but also keep it so you guys are still able to test it.

### Install
clone the resource as a zip to download it, unzip and rename CuffsUP-grimly to CuffsUP 
place in your resource folder and update your server config
we support the newer format fxmanifest so I believe this will only work on newer servers
in the server config put **ensure CuffsUP** and then save your server config, if the server was
running and you want to tset without a restart do in game **/refresh** and then **/start** CuffsUP in chat or **refresh** and **start** CuffsUP in F8

### Upgrade from master/grimly to grimly
Delete the master mod fully from your server including the config, grimly is a idea's build and my have new config changes or tweaks so best to fully remove the older versions or master branch versions, they WONT work side by side.


### Added
* Server side config tool via server console, updater, 


### Note:
Using this grimly build on a active server is a stupid idea, you may use this as you feel fit but I will not be hold responsible for any loss of service or even damage to user or game data, you use all my scripts at your own risk.
